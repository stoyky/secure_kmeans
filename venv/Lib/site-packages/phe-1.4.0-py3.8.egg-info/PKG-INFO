A Python 3 library for Partially Homomorphic Encryption.

The homomorphic properties of the paillier crypto system are:

-  Encrypted numbers can be multiplied by a non encrypted scalar.
-  Encrypted numbers can be added together.
-  Encrypted numbers can be added to non encrypted scalars.

Running unit tests
------------------

::

   python setup.py test

Or use nose::

   nosetests

Note related to gmpy2
---------------------

`gmpy2` is not required to use the library, but is preferred. A pure Python implementation is available but 
`gmpy2` drastically improves performances. As indication on a laptop not dedicated to benchmarking, running the example
`examples/federated_learning_with_encryption.py` provided in the library took:
- 4.5s with `gmpy2` installed
- 35.7s without `gmpy2` installed

However, `gmpy2` is a requirement to run the tests.

Code History
------------

Developed at `Data61 | CSIRO <http://data61.csiro.au>`_.

Parts derived from the Apache licensed Google project:

No audit
--------

This code has neither been written nor vetted by any sort of crypto
expert. The crypto parts are mercifully short, however.
